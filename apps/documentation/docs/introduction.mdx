# Inter Blockchain Communication Framework

IBCF is a building block allowing for general bidirectional message passing between Tezos and Ethereum networks.

It allows smart contracts on a source chain to store ✉️ states that are verifiable on a target chain. It provides a generic way for contracts to communicate between chains by means of validating Merkle proofs about these states stored in the source chain.

# How does it work?

As an initial step, a trusted set of validators is responsible for relaying the state root of snapshots between chains.
It means that for two chains (`A` and `B`), that chain `B` will know the state roots of snapshots contained in chain `A`, and
chain `A` will also know the state roots contained in `B`.

The state roots transmitted in the step above allow smart contracts in a target chain to validate arbitrary states previously stored in a source chain by calling a validatior smart contract with a proof-of-inclusion for that given state.
