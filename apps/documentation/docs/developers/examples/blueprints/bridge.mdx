The bridge blueprint serves as a base implementation for the following use cases:

  - Lock-up and release of tokens;
  - Cross-chain swaps.

**Contracts:**
  - [Tezos - IBCF_Bridge.py](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-hyperdrive/blob/main/contracts/tezos/blueprints/IBCF_Bridge.py)
  - [EVM - IBCF_Bridge.sol](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-hyperdrive/blob/main/contracts/evm/blueprints/IBCF_Bridge.sol)

### Using the demo

1. First, you need to mint some tokens on Ethereum. The deployed asset is a custom ERC20 that allows anyone to mint.

2. Once you have minted some tokens, you need to give an allowance to the bridge. The allowance is the amount you want to bridge to Tezos.

3. You then need to submit the `wrap` operation. It will ask you for an amount and a destination Tezos address.

        <source src={require('@site/static/guides/bridge.mp4').default} type='video/webm' />
    </video>
</div>

<div class="padding-vert--md"></div>

4. You can also `unwrap` the tokens. It does the reverse operation, sending a given amount from Tezos to Ethereum.
