## Relaying Tezos to EVM

The relaying process from Tezos to EVM involves interacting with two contracts (a [State Aggregator](/relay-contracts/tezos/state) and a [Proof Validator](/relay-contracts/evm/validator)).

The :ledger: [**State aggregation**](/relay-contracts/tezos/state) contract acts as a database and proof generator for other contracts in the Tezos ecosystem.
It produces a snapshot of a Merkle tree every `X` blocks, where the root node of the tree is used to validate all the proofs for the given snapshot.

The origin contract address is included on every added state to authenticate the proofs on the EVM chain.

The root node hash (or **state root**) of every snapshot is then transmitted to an EVM contract (:cop: [**Proof Validator**](/relay-contracts/evm/validator)), which allows the contracts on the EVM environment to validate the proofs of :envelope: states added on Tezos at a given snapshot.

## Relaying EVM to Tezos

Relaying from an EVM chain to Tezos, requires the EVM chain to be [EIP-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) enabled and a Tezos (:cop: [**Proof Validator**](/relay-contracts/tezos/validator)) contract capable of validating `EIP-1186` storage proofs.

    }}
  />

The relayer first asks the Tezos (:cop: [**EIP-1186 Proof Validator**](/relay-contracts/tezos/validator)) which snapshot/block level it is expecting, then queries the state root of that level and sends it to the validator.

Applications can then leverage [EIP-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) for producing storage proofs of EVM contracts that get validated on Tezos.

## Decentralization

The relaying solution is not trustless. Applications building on top of it need to trust that the majority of the validators are not faulty.
